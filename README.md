File Flex is an Obsidian plugin that enhances file and folder management by providing advanced undo capabilities. It allows users to revert changes to file and folder locations, as well as names, within a specified time window.

- Customizable time window for undo operations.
- Clear Cache: Provides an option to clear the plugin's cache.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/19msb/obsidian-file-flex/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file.
3. Move the extracted folder to your Obsidian plugins folder:
   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Roaming/obsidian/plugins`
   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/plugins`

4. Enable the plugin in Obsidian:

## Usage

### Undo Changes

- Click on the File Flex icon in the ribbon to undo the most recent changes within the time window.
